## Setup
To use Weather API an [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) key must be set in the extension's preferences.
The [free tier](https://openweathermap.org/price) allows for a million calls a month, or about 22 calls every minute. By default the extension queries the API every five minutes.
The key can be obtained for free by signing up [here](https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_up). It will be activated automatically, up to 2 hours after registration.
