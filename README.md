## Setup
To use Weather API a `WEATHER_API_KEY` env variable, got from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) must be set. The [free tier](https://openweathermap.org/price) allows for a million calls a month, or about 22 calls every minute. By default the extension queries the API every five minutes.
